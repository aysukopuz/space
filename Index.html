                        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot
                            plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the
                            energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. It is the most important source
                            of energy for life on Earth.

                            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System,
                            being larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of
                            war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, and has a crust primarily composed
                            of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel.

                            Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of
                            Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume,
                            Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

                            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the
                            sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares
                            (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the
                            third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
